# shonkwrap

A little script to tidy up your `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.

While we've used this and not had any issues, the shrinkwrap format is not
currently documented or guaranteed not to change, so be careful.

# Install

```sh
npm install -g shonkwrap
```

# Usage

When you'd normally type `npm shinkwrap`, type `shonkwrap` instead.
